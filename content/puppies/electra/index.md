### Personality

Electra could be described as the mellow French Bulldog Puppy sister compared to Sola. She is extremely sweet and easily adjustable to new situations and environments. She is the much smaller and submissive sister, but nonetheless just as special and adorable. Might be a bit shy while adjusting to her new home, so give her time and her personality will shine through. This Merle Frenchie puppy is great with kids and other animals.
