    description = "I went through all different kind of breeders trying to find my forever family.Sadly I did not get any respond....until I found Renee and James!!!!!!!I was at work and sent a message thinking i‚Äôll look to see if I get a reply later.Renee answered in 5 seconds with full details and what I am looking for and my history with dogs.She was so open for me to go to her place and meet the puppies and feel it out. She did not demand any deposit or make me feel the need to take a puppy home. She told me it was perfectly fine to wait for the next litter if I didn‚Äôt find any.The best breeder and helpful to all the puppies she sent out !!!I highly recommend anyone who wants a good frenchie with great temperament!!!!!!"

    description = "My partner and I purchased a French Bulldog from them last year and had a great experience. They allowed us to visit their home and interact with the dogs to make sure we find the perfect match. The puppies mother was on the spot and was extremely social and approved of us playing with her babies. Peach has been super healthy and didn‚Äôt require any vet visits other than the regulars shots! We are planning on adding another Frenchie to our clan in the future and will definitely reach out to you guys soon!!"

E-mailing, texting, and chatting on the phone was very easy with them! We couldn't love our little Frenchie more! Renee stays in touch even after the puppy purchasing process is complete. She will pass along advice and tips to help as the puppy grows. We are very grateful! Thanks again Renee and James for our little girl Charley Rose!"

    description = "So I recently go to my baby Frenchie from Renee and James and it has been such an amazing experience! Let me just say, I spoke to a few different breeders and Renee and James are the only two that I could tell genuinely LOVE their puppies. From the moment I spoke with Renee through e-mail she was very informative and as soon as I asked for videos she send me them instantly! With the video alone you could just hear the love and see how happy then pups are! Also, after I got my puppy Renee has been checking in on him, making sure to answer any questions I have and has been suggesting so many things for my pup which really confirms how much she cares about all the puppies and wants them to find a great home. Thank you so much again for our little Zack, we appreciate you guys so much!!"

They are professional, kind, accommodating and answered all of my questions confidently without hesitation. We brought Pickle home in January of 2019 and Renee still continues to check up on Pickle. If you‚Äôre looking for a well-bred French Bulldog you‚Äôve come to the right breeders at Ethical Frenchie as they uphold the highest standards. I high recommend these lovely people!"
