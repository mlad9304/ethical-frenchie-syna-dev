Socializing our French Bulldog puppies as early as possible makes the transition to its "Furever Home" go that much more smoothly. Just like humans, French Bulldog Puppies tend to have different personality variations. Some might be a bit shyer, while others energetic and spunky. In both cases, we try to establish a routine and prepare them for the outside world that awaits. French Bulldog temperament is sweet, loving and stubborn, if properly socialized.
