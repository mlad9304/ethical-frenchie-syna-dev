We're French Bulldog Breeders, with love and dedication towards this silly and amazing breed. While we realize that adopting should always be the first choice, we understand that sometimes you just want to raise your own Frenchie puppies from day 1. All Frenchie Puppies purchased from us contribute directly to helping neglected and abandoned pets. While our puppies are bred in North Carolina, once ready they take the long trip to New York City where we live. We deliver along the entire east coast, So whatever your location might be, welcome to the Ethical Frenchie.
