### Ingredients

- 2 1⁄2 cups old-fashioned oats,

- 1⁄2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped

- 1⁄2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped

- 1 large egg (see tip below for dogs with allergies to chicken products)

- 1⁄4 cup of water, plus 1 teaspoon

- 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil (unrefined extra-virgin is best)

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 325° F

2. Add oats to a blender and pulse to a flour like consistency. In a large bowl whisk together diced parsley and mint, egg, water, and oil. Add oat flour and stir to combine. Knead dough a few times then turn out onto a lightly floured surface.

3. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten dough to about 1/8″ thick. Using a cookie cutter or knife cut out approximately 40 (1-inch mints) mints. Place mints about 1⁄4-inch a part on a parchment lined or non-stick cookie sheet. Bake 35-40 minutes, or until golden and crispy.

4. Allow mints to cool completely before serving. Store in an airtight container.

5. **Tip:** For dogs with allergies to chicken products, substitute one large egg with 1⁄4 cup unsweetened applesauce.
